\section{Content and procedure}

The assignment required the development of a proposal for a maintenance management system targeted to the UAM maintainers. The \textbf{procedure} followed began with a brainstorming that produced the initial ideas for the proposal and with a research for ideas in similar products. We divided the work between all the team members and started developing the requirements, project definition and design in the Technical Report.

As we had to deliver an oral presentation of our proposal, we prepared the slides based on what we had in our technical report. This was really advantageous and a \textbf{strength} of our procedure as we had everything prepared for the presentation, so we didn't have problems in explaining what we had done.

As a possible \textbf{improvement} of our procedure, we think that we should plan ahead and distribute the work in the first day of the assignment to avoid the \textbf{problem} of accumulated work near the deadlines.
