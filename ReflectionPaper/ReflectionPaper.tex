\section{Content and procedure}

The assignment required the development of a proposal for a maintenance management system targeted to the UAM maintainers. The \textbf{procedure} followed began with a brainstorming that produced the initial ideas for the proposal and with a research for ideas in similar products. We divided the work between all the team members and started developing the requirements, project definition and design in the Technical Report.

As we had to deliver an oral presentation of our proposal, we prepared the slides based on what we had in our technical report. This was really advantageous and a \textbf{strength} of our procedure as we had everything prepared for the presentation, so we didn't have problems in explaining what we had done.

As a possible \textbf{improvement} of our procedure, we think that we should plan ahead and distribute the work in the first day of the assignment to avoid the \textbf{problem} of accumulated work near the deadlines.

\section{Acquired knowledge}

With this assignment we have learned to do a real analysis of a possible product. We never had the chance of thinking in a big application like this one and it's very different to the software we are used to develop.

Thinking in all possible details of the application has been a good experience. We know we have missed some of them, but during the time we have been working, we realized we had missed others that ended up included in the proposal. We can imagine now with a better perspective how a Software Engineering's work is, at least regarding the Analysis and Design parts.

\section{Reflections on future assignments}

For our future assignments, we will have meetings after math class as we have had sometimes in this assignment: we're free during that, we all are in the same place and, even more important, those meetings were more productive than the ones had in EPS or even in class.

For future assignments of the course, we recommend having some time in all the classes to work in the assignments or at least to distribute work for the week. We would like more this than some classes with no working time, and some others were all the time is for working in our assignments.
