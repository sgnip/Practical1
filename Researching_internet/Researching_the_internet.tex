\chapter{Other things we thought about during reseraching}

\section{New ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Preventive maintenance – add a tag for that
\end{itemize}

\section{Things to ask}

\begin{itemize}
\item Apple Watch, Yo, TapToTalk. Does the client want some functionality like those ones? \ref{AppleWatch}

\item Can every handyman fix everything? May be there should be categories of faults to be fixed by some particular handyman.
\item Tracking handyman's time at work? To see how much have they worked or how much time is needed for some problems. Automatic or manual time tracking?
\item What happens if a handyman depends on something external to fix some fault? Nothing, right?
\end{itemize}

\section{Suggested webpages to look at}

Ivan's fault if this is empty xD

\section{Our own webpages to look at}

\subsection{Wunderlist}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nice interface to take into account for the task management.
\item Maybe shared list's so every handyman in science building can see pending task of others. (to ask)
\item See completed faults you fix. (pretty obvious).
\item Dead line for each fault, automatically set by the system taking into account the priority and the category. (to ask) 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Apple watch/YoApp/TapToTalk} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Add some sort of really fast communication between handymen, so they don't have to call one another.
\item Add few types of default messages like “I'm going” or “Impossible” or “Need help”
\item Things to think about:
\begin{itemize}\label{AppleWatch}
\item ¿broadcast messages to all handyman? ¿Just to a few? Maybe making groups and you send notification to a group.
\item May be we should add some not so fast but more efficient communication way for handyman.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trello}

\begin{itemize}
\item Public taskboard that anyone can see? Only registered members?
\item Add one more state to task (pending, working, finished or impossible) better than wunderlist system (done or todo).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Asana}
\begin{itemize}
 	\item  Dead line = due date or hour date??
\end{itemize}
