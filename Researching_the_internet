Preventive maintenance – add a tag for that

General things to ask:
- Can every handyman fix everything? May be there should be categories of faults to be fixed by some particular handyman.
- Tracking handyman's time at work? To see how much have they worked or how much time is needed for some problems. Automatic or manual time tracking?
- What happens if a handyman depends on something external to fix some fault? Nothing, right?




Wunderlist: 
- Nice interface to take into account for the task management.
- Maybe shared list's so every handyman in science building can see pending task of others. (to ask)
- See completed faults you fix. (pretty obvious).
- Dead line for each fault, automatically set by the system taking into account the priority and the category. (to ask) 


Apple watch/YoApp/TapToTalk (to ask):
- Add some sort of really fast communication between handymen, so they don't have to call one another.
- Add few types of default messages like “I'm going” or “Impossible” or “Need help”
- Things to think about:
+ ¿broadcast messages to all handyman? ¿Just to a few? Maybe making groups and you send notification to a group.
+ May be we should add some not so fast but more efficient communication way for handyman.

Trello:
- Public taskboard that anyone can see? Only registered members?
- Add one more state to task (pending, working, finished or impossible) better than wunderlist system (done or todo).

Asana: 
Dead line = due date or hour date??
