\chapter{Introduction}

The Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) has reported the numerous problems it has detecting faults that arise on its campus and its facilities, whose reparation usually takes excessive time and is poorly organized. A late detection of faults in the facilities delays its reparation, stopping its users to continue using them as normal and complicating the maintenance staff labour. Regarding the wishes of the campus users and realizing the potential maintenance problems it has, the UAM has organised a contest to choose the best project proposal that solves them.

This is where our organization, Triforce, enters the scene: we have analysed the problem exhaustively and designed a web application, Fault Manager Lite (FML), that meets all the requirements expected, solves the problems and also includes new extra features that makes it even more useful.

\section{Purpose} The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the functionalities of the FML system. Starting from the project definition, this document will inform the reader about the goals and the different subsystems that form our application. Then, it will cover each of the system's intended features (functional and non-functional requirements), as well as offer a preliminary glimpse of the software application's User Interface (UI).

The intended audience of this document is all of the stakeholders for a project involving the development of software web application for maintenance services. This includes, but is not limited to, all members of the UAM community (students, teaching
and research staff and administration and services personnel), all members of the maintenance staff of the UAM and, more generally, every potential user of this application.

\section{Structure}

In this chapter, we introduce you to the purpose of this document, some definitions and the methodology used during the development of this proposal.

An exhaustive definition of this project can be found on chapter \ref{chapProjectDefinition}, where we state the goals of the system, its functionalities and the proposed modules.

All the requirements are detailed in the chapter \ref{chapRequirements}, where functional and non-functional requirements are specified, explained and justified.

Chapter \ref{chapDesign} defines the visual design of the application, stating the motivation for our choices and the user experience that will be delivered with this project.

Finally, we conclude with chapter \ref{chapConclusions}, where we will sum up all the points exposed in this report and will present compelling reasons for why our proposal should be the chosen one.

As annexes, in appendix \ref{chapBrainstorming} we write down the transcription of our initial brainstorming, the seed of this proposal. We evaluate the current technology that could be used to solve the UAM's problems in appendix \ref{chapCurrentTechnology}, and in appendix \ref{chapMeetings} we reproduce the announcements and minutes of our meetings. We also include the interview with the UAM's maintenance administrator in appendix \ref{chapInterview}


\section{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SRS: } Software Requirements Specification.

\item \textbf{FML: } Fault Manager Lite. This is the System's name.

\item \textbf{UAM: } \textit{Universidad Autónoma de Madrid}, Madrid's Autonomous University, the client for whom this project will be developed.

\item \textbf{GUI: } Graphical User Interface.

\item \textbf{GPS: } Global Positioning System.

\item \textbf{SQL: } Structured Query Language, often used as synonymous of relational database systems.

\item \textbf{Devops: } Team responsible for the deployment and maintenance of the software.

\end{itemize}


\section{Methodology}

The methodological procedure followed for preparing the SRS of the software system FML we have developed includes the following techniques:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Deep analysis of the information given by the UAM: the potential maintenance problem it has, the causes that led to this problem and various aspects we must consider before proceeding to the next step (web application that must work on PCs, tablets and smartphones; target users; basic purpose).
\item Application of the technique of brainstorming to generate ideas for the application. Brainstorming was then applied to these general ideas in order to give shape to them. The results of the brainstorm carried out are shown in the Annex \ref{chapBrainstorming}. This step resulted on the detection of 5 subsystems.
\item Research on the Internet about other similar systems, analyzing the functionality of these systems and describing them in a structured way by specifying their advantages and disadvantages, and extracting good ideas to incorporate to our own project, increasing its market value. These ideas also helped putting the final touches to our ideas from the brainstorm. The research is included in annex \ref{chapCurrentTechnology}.
\item Interview with one member of the UAM's technical staff. In this interview we clarified the obscure ideas we still had, and modified some of our previous ideas to adapt them to the answers given. The answers to the interview were well-considered; as the technical staff will be the main user of our application, their point of view is important to us. The interview is included in annex \ref{chapInterview}.
\item Departing from the ideas obtained, define the requirements (functional and non-functional) of the application and design attractive mock-ups that fulfill them. These mock-ups are only a demo and may change in the final version of the application.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Project Definition}
\label{chapProjectDefinition}

FML is based on the jolly cooperation between the users of the facilities of the UAM campus and the maintenance staff in charge of them.

As the users will be the ones that will detect the sooner faults on the facilities the campus offers them, they are also the most suitable to report the problems they are having, in order to getting them fixed as soon as possible. With the FML web application, it will only take less than a minute to fill the form and send it to the maintenance staff.

Using the reports of faults detected in the campus, the maintenance personnel will stop losing its precious time revising the installations looking for faults and will be able to focus on the repairs. Apart from this benefit, the maintenance staff will also have a better way to coordinate efforts, as the FML will provide an automatic assignment system to assign repairs to each of the members avoiding overloading any of them and taking into account their distance to the problem, saving time on displacements.

In summary, the users will be able to easily report faults on facilities they are using in order to have them fixed in the less time possible, while the maintenance personnel will multiply its current performance as the majority of their resources will stop being wasted on revisions, but on repairs. We state that the FML web application is the answer to the UAM problems, as we will show you with this SRS.


\section{Goals and functionalities}

Our main goal is the development of an extremely functional, bug-free web application, that runs either on PCs, tablets or smartphones and facilitates the labor of the maintenance staff of the UAM.

Based on the jolly cooperation between the members of the UAM community (students, teaching and research staff and administration and services personnel) and the maintenance personnel of the facilities and installations of the UAM campus, this application has been designed to solved the potential maintenance problems that the UAM has declared to have.

The problems we aim to alleviate with this application include the following:


\begin{itemize}
\item Difficulty of detecting faults on facilities of the campus.
\item Late detection of the problems, which implies repairs are not done on time.
\item Excessive resources and time wasted on revisions looking for potential faults.
\item Bad coordination between members of the technical staff.
\item Frequent overloading of some repairmen because of bad coordination.
\item Inability of a repairman to instantly inform that a fault has just been solved.
\item Difficulty of the users to report faults to the maintenance services.
The report system lacks of mobile functionality.
\item Lack of real-time visualization of pending and finished repairs.
\item Lack of real-time visualization of assigned tasks.
\item No faults history.
\item No statistics of faults.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}

\paragraph{Main Purpose} Achieving the homogeneity between the different departments of the UAM maintenance service and the active collaboration of its members as fault reporters.

The application will manage fault collection and management as described in the requirements in chapter \ref{secRequirements}. It will be responsible too of the management of the user's role inside the application. Every other aspect regarding users profile and authentication is responsibility of the UAM's login and user system.

\paragraph{Milestones} Starting in March 2015, the software system would be completely implemented by the end of the current course in June 2015, and then fully set up by the first semester of the new course in September 2015.

\paragraph{Costs} Estimated total costs ascend to 180,000 \euro{} (including development, salaries and personnel formation).

\section{Subsystems or Modules}

The FML system has been designed to resolve these problems making use of a user-friendly interface, avoiding unnecessary or distracting buttons or effects. This system has been divided in several modules listed below, each of those offering one specific functionality and, in conjunction, solving the problems mentioned above:
\begin{itemize}
\item Task Manager.
\item Report System.
\item Notifications and Messaging System.
\item Users and Profile Managers.
\item Faults History.
\end{itemize}

There are several applications 'on the market' which are similar to our proposed app in some way or another and they could represent real and competitive alternatives to ours. However, none of these web applications can offer all the features FML offers (furthermore, we plan on adding some features which are not currently available in any of these applications), so our system is indeed the best solution proposed to solve the problems the UAM maintenance staff has to deal with. After our research of the Internet, a comparison of these competitors applications is gathered in Annex \ref{chapCurrentTechnology}.

\chapter{Design and Mock-ups}
\label{chapDesign}

\section{Motivation}

This application's purpose is to solve a problem, not to create new. Thus, the design should not interfere with the technicians or the users work. Instead, it must reduce friction to almost zero, so it has to be easy to use and easy to learn. Adoption by the student corp of the application is critical to this project, so the design should accommodate to this requirement.

We want the application to be full-featured, so all the users of the app should be able to use all the features from whichever device they're working in: tablet, smartphone or PC. We don't want anybody to stop reporting a fault because they don't have their laptop with them, for example.

This leads to a natural decision regarding the technologies used to develop the interface: we will use web technologies and responsive design to maximize code reuse. In this way, we will be able to deliver a high quality user experience and homogeneous among devices with minimal code and improved maintainability.

In turn, this will allow us to reduce costs and will make the development more agile, as we will be able to deliver quickly changes to the application responding to feedback from users.


\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\caption{Sample responsive design in wide screens (laptops, tablets in landscape position, PCs) with the menu showing up and large interface elements .}
\label{imgWideScreens}
\end{figure}

In this report, we will include, for brevity, the mockups for a mobile application, as we consider it will be the most used interface for the system. Given that we will be using responsive design, the looks will be the same for every device, except for widened interface elements and a navigation menu that shows up if there's enough space (see figure \ref{imgWideScreens} compared with the corresponding mobile view on figure  \ref{imgFaultLog}).

\section{Design}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/MainPage.png}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.1\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Settings.png}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Main page and settings page for Fault Manager Lite}
\label{imgMainPage}
\end{figure}

We show some mock-ups of the application, specifically designed to show the flow in certain use cases.

\subsection{Reporting a fault}

From the main screen (figure \ref{imgMainPage}), when the user presses the button ``Report'', he will be able to choose a category for the fault, then will fill the details and then get a page acknowledging the report and showing the estimated response time (figure \ref{imgReportFlow}). They may see a message popup (\ref{imgDuplicateReport}) if a possible duplicated report is detected.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Categories.png}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.02\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ReportPage.png}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.02\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/ReportReceived.png}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Basic flow for reporting a fault.}
\label{imgReportFlow}.
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/DuplicateMessage.jpg}
\caption{When a possible duplicate is found, the user is asked if he or she wants to continue with the report.}
\label{imgDuplicateReport}
\end{figure}

For the location, we will show the user a map and also a list with all the possible options (figure \ref{imgLocation}). The user will be able to select specific places (for example, a certain lab or classroom) or more generic (e.g., third floor or the whole building). If localization APIs are available on the device (either location by AGPS or WiFi), the application will use them to show the user the best location option.


\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Map.png}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.02\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Location.png}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Location screens for the application}
\label{imgLocation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fault tracking}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/FaultLog.png}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.02\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Messaging.png}
\end{minipage}
\caption{Fault log and messaging screen for the application.}
\label{imgTracking}
\end{figure}

The user will be able to see the faults he's been subscribed too, either because he reported them or because he marked them as duplicated. The figure \ref{imgTracking} shows how can he see all his faults and the chat screen that will show up if the technicians need to clarify details of the report.


\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/AllFaults.jpg}
\caption{The users can see all the faults.}
\label{imgAllFaults}
\end{figure}

As specified on the requirements, the users will be able to see all the faults in the system (figure \ref{imgAllFaults}). To improve usability, we will include a search option so the users can find teh reports they're interested in.

\subsection{Interface for technicians}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/SolvedFault.jpg}
\caption{The technicians will have controls to mark a fault as solved or communicate with the users.}
\label{imgSolvedFault}
\end{figure}

To reduce costs and improve mantainability, most of the code and interface will be shared between user roles. This means that the common screens (main screen, settings, fault lists and report information) will be the same for technicians, with maybe some additional elements (see figure \ref{imgSolvedFault}).

The technicians will be able to see their assigned tasks in a slightly modified interface of the one normal users see (figure \ref{imgFaultLog}), so they will be able to check the priority and state of the fault. The contextual menu of each task will allow the user to mark the fault as duplicate or assign it to someone (if the technician hasn't got managing responsibilities, he will only be able to assign the to him/herself).

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/TechFaultLog.jpg}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.02\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/TechAssign.jpg}
\end{minipage}
\caption{The technicians will see additional information in the faults page.}
\label{imgFaultLog}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interface for admins}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/AssignRemoveUser.jpg}
\end{minipage}
\hspace{0.02\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Users.jpg}
\end{minipage}
\caption{The managers will be able to see all the users, change their role or remove them.}
\label{imgUsers}
\end{figure}


As stated in the previous section, most of the code will be shared. This means that admins will mostly see the same screens as technicians with some minor tweaks. For example, when they list all the faults (figure \ref{imgFaultLog}), they will be able to assign them to any technician under their management.

The screens that are specific to admins are shown in figure \ref{imgUsers}, they're related to the user management subsystem.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapConclusions}

As we stated in the introduction, we think Triforce's solution, presented in this report, is the best tailored to solve current UAM's maintenance structure problems. We can deliver in a timely fashion a reliable, easy to use and useful system that can replace without hassle the currently deployed one.

Our proposal will allow us to listen to every user of the application and react accordingly, applying agile development techniques and continuous feedback and testing.

Fault Manager Lite will be easily and quickly deployed: because of our care and dedication to a polished user experience, formation will not be required for any user as the application and the system will be easy to use for everyone.

We consider the quality to price ratio of our proposal is high, and awarding the project to Triforce would be the best way to invest university assets currently being wasted in an inefficient system.

The biggest limitation for this proposal is the automatic localization system. Even though we've tried to find the best way to avoid wasting the users time on the selection of the fault's location, current technology is not 100\% precise and, depending on the construction of each building on campus, WiFi location may not work accurately enough.

Repeated faults are also a concern because they require additional time from the maintenance managers in order to sort through them. Taking into account that the faults are registered by users using a lot of natural language, duplicate detection is not going to be accurate enough to completely avoid the problem.

Finally, the last limitation of our proposal is that we don't offer features to control user behaviour, such as false reports or spam. Administrators will have to intervene manually and remove permissions from the infractors if they consider it necessary. However, given that Fault Manager Lite is a system specifically targeted to the UAM community, we don't think this will pose a problem.

For this application to work properly, the cooperation with UAM community members is \textbf{essential}. We are concerned of it so our decisions aim to achieve this goal. We think our specially crafted, easy to use interface, will smooth the path to it. The option of earning points that can be traded ECTS credits - if the user is a student, of course - will also help to boost adoption. For all other members of the community there is no rewarding system, more than the satisfaction of helping the UAM to improve and get better for everybody on campus.
