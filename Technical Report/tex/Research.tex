Ivan's fault if this is empty xD

\section{Our own webpages to look at}

\subsection{Wunderlist}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nice interface to take into account for the task management.
\item Maybe shared list's so every handyman in science building can see pending task of others. (to ask)
\item See completed faults you fix. (pretty obvious).
\item Dead line for each fault, automatically set by the system taking into account the priority and the category. (to ask)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Apple watch/YoApp/TapToTalk}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add some sort of really fast communication between handymen, so they don't have to call one another.
\item Add few types of default messages like “I'm going” or “Impossible” or “Need help”
\item Things to think about:
\begin{itemize}\label{AppleWatch}
\item ¿broadcast messages to all handyman? ¿Just to a few? Maybe making groups and you send notification to a group.
\item May be we should add some not so fast but more efficient communication way for handyman.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trello}

\begin{itemize}
\item Public taskboard that anyone can see? Only registered members?
\item Add one more state to task (pending, working, finished or impossible) better than wunderlist system (done or todo).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Asana}
\begin{itemize}
 	\item  Dead line = due date or hour date??
\end{itemize}
